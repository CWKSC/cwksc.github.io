# Explain: Calculation of Estimate

This part is a straightforward application of the formula derived in part (a).
We found that the Maximum Likelihood Estimate for $\lambda$ is simply the sample mean $\bar{k}$.

To find the sample mean from a frequency table:
1. Sum the products of the value and its frequency ($k \times \text{count}$).
2. Divide by the total number of observations (total cells).

The value $\lambda \approx 0.929$ means that, on average, slightly less than 1 bomb fell in each grid square. The fact that many squares had 0 hits (229 of them) and some had 4 or 5 is characteristic of random scattering.
