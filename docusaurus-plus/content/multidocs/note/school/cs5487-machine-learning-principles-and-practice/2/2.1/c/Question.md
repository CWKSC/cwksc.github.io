## Problem 2.1 (c)

The following table lists the number of cells that were observed to have $k$ hits (this is Clarke's actual data!).

| number of hits ($k$) | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 and over |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| number of cells with $k$ hits | 229 | 211 | 93 | 35 | 7 | 1 |

(c) Using the above data, calculate the ML estimate $\hat{\lambda}$ for the Poisson distribution.
