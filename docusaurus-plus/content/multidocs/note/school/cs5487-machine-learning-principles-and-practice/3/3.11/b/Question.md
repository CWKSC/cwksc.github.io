(b) Consider the MAP estimate,

$$
\hat{\theta}_{MAP} = \operatorname*{argmax}_\theta p(\theta|\mathcal{D}). \quad (3.47)
$$

How does it differ from the least squares estimate and the weighted-least squares estimate?
What is the role of the terms that were not present before? Is there any advantage in setting them to anything other than zero?
