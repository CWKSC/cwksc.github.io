## Problem 3.8(c)

Given the posterior in (3.33), show that the predictive distribution is

$$
p(x|\mathcal{D}) = \left(\frac{s+1}{n+2}\right)^x \left(1-\frac{s+1}{n+2}\right)^{1-x}. \quad (3.34)
$$

What is the effective Bayesian estimate of $\pi$? What is the intuitive explanation in terms of "virtual" samples added to an equivalent MLE estimate?
