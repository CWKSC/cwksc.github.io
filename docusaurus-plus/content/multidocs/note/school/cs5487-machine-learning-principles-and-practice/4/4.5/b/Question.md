## Problem 4.5 Flying Bombs, part II – EM for mixtures of Poissons

(b) Implement your algorithm and run it for different values of $K \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ on the following data obtained from 2 cities (learn a separate mixture model for each city):

| city | number of hits ($k$) | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 and over |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| London | number of cells with $k$ hits | 229 | 211 | 93 | 35 | 7 | 1 |
| Antwerp | number of cells with $k$ hits | 325 | 115 | 67 | 30 | 18 | 21 |

What conclusions can you make about the attacks on each city? Is there any evidence to suggest there is specific targeting of areas in London or Antwerp?
